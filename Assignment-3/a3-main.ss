 ;Basic Usage:
 ;
 ;To use the driver for Assignment 1, create a file containing:

 (eval-when (compile load eval)
   (optimize-level 2)
   (case-sensitive #t)
 )

 (load "match.ss")
 (load "helpers.ss")
 (load "fmts.pretty")     ; inform pretty-print about new forms
 (load "driver.ss")

 (load "a3.ss")
 (load "a3-wrapper.ss")   ; defines syntactic forms and procedures
                          ; needed to output of each pass
 (compiler-passes '(
   verify-scheme
   finalize-locations
   expose-basic-blocks
   flatten-program
   ;generate-x86-64
 ))

(load "tests3.ss")
(test-all)
